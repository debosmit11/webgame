1.move profession selection screen as orc is already a paladin instead roll a d20 dice to select the attributes of the character such as streanth, dex, int, wisdom and and hit points acording to dnd rules

2. add a weather feature in which on a dice20 roll a roll of 1-5 means awful weather with heavy downpour, a roll of 6-10 means overcast and gloomy weather, a roll of 11-15 means warm weather with a few clouds in distance and 16-20 means perfect weather.
also add chance encounter which also uses a d20 roll in which the higher the roll the better the encounter and a d20 means getting a new companion or magical item and similarly lower the number on the dice means higher the chance of getting a trap or a monster encounter with d1 meaning a dangerous encounter.

3. increase the role of the companions in the story such as dialogue opions and using their respective class specific actions.

4. add a dnd stye turn based combat mechanic based on dice roll to make the game more intresting.
