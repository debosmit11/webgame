a project to make an online fantasy game using dnd rules 
1.move profession selection screen as orc is already a paladin instead roll a d20 dice to select the attributes of the character such as streanth, dex, int, wisdom and and hit points acording to dnd rules

2. add a weather feature in which on a dice20 roll a roll of 1-5 means awful weather with heavy downpour, a roll of 6-10 means overcast and gloomy weather, a roll of 11-15 means warm weather with a few clouds in distance and 16-20 means perfect weather.
also add chance encounter which also uses a d20 roll in which the higher the roll the better the encounter and a d20 means getting a new companion or magical item and similarly lower the number on the dice means higher the chance of getting a trap or a monster encounter with d1 meaning a dangerous encounter.

3. increase the role of the companions in the story such as dialogue opions and using their respective class specific actions.

4. add a dnd stye turn based combat mechanic based on dice roll to make the game more intresting.
   
5.from the above given script.js give me a code to make a side bar where we add an inventory feature where i can add items for the party such as potions and gold , also ad another section in the side bar which includes party management which can alter the current party members from the ones we meet through the story , maximum party member for a party is 4.

6. add an reward system where party is rewarded with either some gold or potions or equivalent after every successful fight.
   
7. add an equipment section where party can buy equipment from towns and villages with the gold aquired.
  
8. add a resting system where resting can restore hp.

9.implement a level up system for tha party members for each major story mission such as first level up is after saving greenhollow, second level up is after saving silver brooke, and the third level up is after travelling through whispering woods and reaching goldenspire,
                        
10.a chatbox will popup in the game saying congratulations you have leveled up after reaching any of these above milestones mentioned in the story player can then click continue to evel up each member in the current party 

11.the level up system consists of giving extra hit points to each party menber in the range of 1d8, and 3 stat points are awarded which the player can add to increase the current stat.   

12.extra spells and skills are awarded for diff classes such as paladin gets sanctuary skill which halves the damage given to all party members for 3 turns, fighter recieves charge which gives double damage when hit, and similar skills for each class, for each level increase, players can only use 1 attack and 2 skills or spells at a time so make a seperate section in the sidebar to help them choose. also add more skills and spells to monsters and enemies.
